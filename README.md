This project started as a simple pong game. In fact the simplest pong game that I could create, using 
tdd and the c++ core guidelines, but being on the road I couldn't resist to just write a mini-game engine
to help me do the job.

The purpose of this is to practice what I know about c++, games in c++ (mainly 2d at the moment), 3 party libs,
etc, and also learn more.
