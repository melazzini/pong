 # README

This project is about test-driving a simple 2d game engine, which could use different backend apis (gtk, sdl, ...).
I'm also creating a Pong game to help drive the design.

Facineroso is the layer that creates the abstraction from the backend libraries.
Pichon is the actual game engine.
Pong is the classic pong game.
